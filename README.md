# Random Filepath Displayer
Random Filepath Displayer (codenamed RandomFileDisplayer) is a basic C Linux program that does two things:

 - It randomly selects the file path from a directory specified by a
   user. All specified directories are stored in a local dirs.txt file.
 - It can open the last displayed file by using the system's default
   software. This means that whatever text editor you use to open a .txt
   file will be used to open randomly chosen .txt file, if it is present
   in your specified directory.
